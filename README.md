# code

This is a collection of all of the different scripting projects that I've completed over the last year or two. Not all of the scripts will work, and 90+% of them won't work without modifying file locations, or other information.

This is intended to be a complete code repository, and not as a tutorial. If you have questions about any of the scripts in the repository, please feel free to ask about them. Since these were mostly developed to make my job easier, I didn't bother adding comments or explanations for most of them.
